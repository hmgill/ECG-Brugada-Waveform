# Training Configuration for Brugada ECG Classification

# Model
model:
  architecture: "resnet1d"
  size: "medium"  # Options: small, medium, large
  dropout: 0.3  # Increased from 0.5

# Loss Function
loss:
  type: "weighted_bce"  # Options: bce, weighted_bce, focal
  pos_weight: 2.5  #< good for bce
  # For focal loss:
  # alpha: 0.25  # Weight for positive class (0.21 = 76/363 for our data)
  # gamma: 2.0   # Focusing parameter (2.0 is standard)#

# Training
