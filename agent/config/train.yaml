# Training Configuration for Brugada ECG Classification

# Model
model:
  architecture: "transformer"  # Changed to transformer
  size: "small"  # Start with small for 363 samples
  dropout: 0.3

# Loss Function
loss:
  type: "weighted_bce"
  pos_weight: 2.5

# Training
training:
  max_epochs: 150  # Transformers may need more epochs
  learning_rate: 0.0001  # Slightly lower for transformers
  weight_decay: 0.01  # Higher weight decay for transformers
  
  # Learning rate scheduler
  scheduler:
    type: "cosine"  # Cosine annealing works well with transformers
    t_max: 150
  
  # Early stopping
  early_stopping:
    monitor: "val_loss"
    patience: 30  # More patience for transformers
    mode: "min"
